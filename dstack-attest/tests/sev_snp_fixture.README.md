# AMD SEV-SNP attestation test fixture

Real AMD SEV-SNP attestation captured from a live dstack CVM, used by
`tests/sev_snp_verify.rs` for an offline end-to-end verification test.

## Files

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sev_snp_attestation.bin` | `VersionedAttestation` (SCALE V0) — the full attestation as produced inside the CVM. Contains the 1184-byte SNP report + the `mr_config` document. |
| `sev_snp_ask.pem` | AMD SEV intermediate cert (ASK, `CN=SEV-Milan`) for the chip that signed the report. |
| `sev_snp_vcek.pem` | Per-chip VCEK (`CN=SEV-VCEK`) for the report's `chip_id` + reported TCB. |

The AMD root key (ARK) is **not** bundled — `sev-snp-qvl` uses its built-in ARK,
so the test verifies the full chain ARK → ASK → VCEK → report signature with
nothing fetched from AMD KDS (fully offline / deterministic).

## Provenance

- Captured 2026-06-17 from a dstack SEV-SNP CVM (app `attest-test`) running the
  merged `dstack-nvidia-0.6.0.a2` image on an AMD EPYC Milan host.
- Generated inside the guest with:
  ```
  dstack-util quote-report \
    --report-data 6174746573742d746573742d666978747572652d32303236 \
    --output attest.json
  ```
  (`report-data` = ASCII `attest-test-fixture-2026`, the marker the test asserts.)
- The `attestation` hex field of that JSON was decoded to `sev_snp_attestation.bin`.
- The unsigned outer `config.sev_snp_measurement` JSON has been normalized to the
  current schema by removing the obsolete standalone `rootfs_hash` field; rootfs
  identity remains in the measured `dstack.rootfs_hash=...` cmdline.
- ASK/VCEK were fetched from AMD KDS (`https://kdsintf.amd.com/vcek/v1/Milan/...`)
  for the report's `chip_id` and TCB and pinned here so the test stays offline.

```

## Refreshing

VCEK/ASK are immutable for a given chip + TCB, so these never expire. If the
report itself is regenerated (e.g. different host or firmware), re-capture all
three files together — the VCEK must match the new report's `chip_id`/TCB.
